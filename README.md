# ESOGU-ML5EV Cleaned Dataset

This repository provides the **ESOGU-ML5EV** dataset, which contains cleaned measurement data for an L5-class electric vehicle designed for urban cargo transportation. The data was collected under various speeds, load conditions, and driving dynamics.

## Overview

- **Vehicle Type**: L5-class electric vehicle for urban cargo logistics  
- **Data Collection**: Approximately 2 km loop route with varying slopes and environmental conditions  
- **Speeds**: 15, 25, and 35 km/h, tested both loaded and unloaded  
- **Frequency**: 1-second intervals  
- **Files**: 35 CSV files containing the cleaned data  

This dataset offers a structured, reusable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in:  
- Examining the energy consumption of light electric vehicles  
- Investigating factors influencing energy usage  
- Developing range estimation methodologies  
- Exploring electric vehicle routing and scheduling problems
